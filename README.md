# Student Performance Analysis 

In this notebook we perform analysis on the dataset obtained from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance .

## Introduction 
We use python and its libraries to perform analysis on the dataset which is obtained from UC Irvine Repository. Following the analysis we create a few models and test their performance to see which one is the best performing  
in order to deploy the selected model and display it on a front end using HTML and CSS. The approach here is to use ExpressJS to create an API which can be used to communicate with the machine learning model in order to allow  
users to be able to enter their own data and get output
